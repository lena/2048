# 2048
A hacked clone of Gabriele Cirulli's game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048), which is a [clone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024) of a [clone](http://saming.fr/p/2048/)...

## How To Play:
Use your *arrow keys* to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they *merge into one by addition!*
The goal of the game is to reach the highest number you can before you run out of room, as new tiles (2's and 4's) crop up with every move.

## New "God Mode" Feature:
Click on one or more *empty tiles* to add tile values instantly.
